# Homelab K3s

As part of my homelab setup I created a load of yaml files
to help getting my k3s setup as needed. 

I'll add more as and when I create more services.

Feel free to keep an eye on [my blog](https://www.iamjack.co.uk/blog) 
where I will add more information and guides on how the setup
works.
